Y2K-Style Page

A simple, nostalgic Y2K-era landing page built with React, Vite & Tailwind CSS.


This project is a fun, visual tribute to the early 2000s web aesthetic—bright gradients, simple animations, glossy buttons and Y2K vibes.
It’s built to serve as a landing page template you can fork and extend for side-projects, portfolios or promotional microsites.
